Lyrics:
-------
Your life is not complete
And for some reason I believed
I could colour in your felt-tip tears with imagine stationery
So I cut around your lines
And I super-glued our lives
And if love is for the living baby
You must be alive
And I know I dream in colour 
But my life is black and white
It wasn't love...

And when I can't decide
I let you make up my mind
But our dictionary characters don't symbolise real life
And although I re-embraced
We represent the human race
It's a different relationship girl 
Now you're out of place
And it hurts to let you go
but Honey now I realised 
It wasn't love...

To honour my mistake
Or perhaps for old times sake
I'll raise a glass, propose a toast
And down a few in your name
Then for one final time
I'll say I wish that you were mine
It wasn't love...
It wasn't love...
It wasn't love...
